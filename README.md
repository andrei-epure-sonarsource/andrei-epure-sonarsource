I am an Engineering Manager in the Code Orchestration Team at @SonarSource. 
Before that, I worked for more than six years on the code analyzers that power our awesome products:
- [SonarQube Server](https://www.sonarqube.org/) - on-prem analysis (has a free Community Build edition)
- [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) - SaaS (free for open-source)
- [SonarQube for the IDE](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) - IDE plugins, free for everyone :smile: 

These tools are used by millions of developers and tens of thousands of organizations use to deliver cleaner, more secure code.
